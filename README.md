# Simple Tree Sort Program
A minimal implementation of tree sort (binary search tree) that sorts numbers, matching the style of a simple bubble sort example.
## How It Works
1. You specify how many numbers you want to sort
2. You enter all the numbers one by one
3. The program sorts them using a binary search tree (BST)
4. It displays the sorted numbers
##How To Use
1. Run the program
2. Enter how many numbers you want to sort (e.g., 5)
3. Input each number when prompted
4. See the sorted result
[Example:]
Enter number of inputs: 3
Input 1: 5
Input 2: 2
Input 3: 7
Sorted numbers: [2, 5, 7]


# Simple Bubble Sort Program
A straightforward implementation of the bubble sort algorithm that allows users to input a specified number of integers and sort them in either ascending or descending order.
## How It Works
1. You specify how many numbers you want to input.
2. You enter each number one by one.
3. The program sorts the numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.
4. You can choose to display the sorted list in ascending or descending order.
##How To Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter how many numbers you want to sort (e.g., 5).
3. Input each number when prompted.
4. Choose whether to display the sorted list in ascending or descending order.
5. See the final sorted result.
[Example:]
Enter how many numbers you want to input:
Number of inputs: 3
Enter numbers one by one.
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 7
How would you like to display the final sorted list? (type 'asc' for ascending or 'desc' for descending): asc
Final sorted list: [2, 5, 7]
