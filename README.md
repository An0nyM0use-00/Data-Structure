# Simple Tree Sort Program

A minimal implementation of tree sort (binary search tree) that sorts numbers, matching the style of a simple bubble sort example.

## How It Works

1. You specify how many numbers you want to sort
2. You enter all the numbers one by one
3. The program sorts them using a binary search tree (BST)
4. It displays the sorted numbers
