# Simple Tree Sort Program

A minimal implementation of tree sort (binary search tree) that sorts numbers, matching the style of a simple bubble sort example.

## How It Works

1. You specify how many numbers you want to sort
2. You enter all the numbers one by one
3. The program sorts them using a binary search tree (BST)
4. It displays the sorted numbers

##How To Use
1. Run the program
2. Enter how many numbers you want to sort (e.g., 5)
3. Input each number when prompted
4. See the sorted result
[Example:]
Enter number of inputs: 3
Input 1: 5
Input 2: 2
Input 3: 7
Sorted numbers: [2, 5, 7]
